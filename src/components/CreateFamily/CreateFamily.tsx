      <p>
        Hello! Welcome to Chore. We can't seem to find you in our system, so we
        think you might be new.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are looking to join someone else's family, they will need to send
        you an invite link.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, we can help you create a household. All we need is a family
        name and you can start inviting members and setting up chores!
      </p>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Family Name" />
    </>
